Table \ref{tab:outreach} shows the overall plan for community
outreach.   Budget shown is total costs, including indirect (except
that no indirect is included for CloudBank usage).  The personnel item is 10\%
of total personnel costs for all project key personnel, as this is a
minimum estimate of personnel time spent on outreach activities.
