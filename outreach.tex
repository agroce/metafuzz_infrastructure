Table 1 shows the plan for community
outreach.   Budget shown is total costs 
 (no indirect is included for CloudBank and participant costs).   Personnel is 1 week of CMU co-PI time, and 10\%
of total costs for other non-NAU personnel, a
minimum estimate of outreach effort.  As lead institution, NAU
outreach personnel time is set at 20\% to account for lead role in
Slack/advisory board/and other efforts.  For CloudBank, in each year we
are reserving 80\% of the CloudBank allocation for outside users to
perform experiments and ``test-drive'' the infrastructure, as an
inducement to learn and contribute suggestions to the
evaluation/ensemble portion of infrastructure.
