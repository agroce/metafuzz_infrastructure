\anh{Proposals must define metrics relevant to the proposal goals and address measurement and evaluation of the infrastructure. 
Possible metrics to consider include infrastructure utilization, usability of infrastructure by researchers, diversity of users, 
and publications that report experiments done on the infrastructure (especially by researchers other than the PIs).}

As we will be managing and releasing software via an open repository, 
natural user-facing metrics to evaluate community buy-in and uptake include the number of forks, downloads, contributors, pull requests, questions, 
stars, and feature requests. 
We will also keep track of the provenance of our user base. While this project is targeted towards supporting the research community, 
we anticipate active interest and participation from industry. 
Infrastructure-specific metrics will include the number, size, and diversity of fuzzers and benchmarks supported by our framework over time.

We will also keep track of the number of citations and experiments enabled by our infrastructure, as well 
as other indicators of interests such as social media mentions or blog posts.
When possible, we will also keep track of the numbers and types of security-critical bugs uncovered using meta-fuzzing.
