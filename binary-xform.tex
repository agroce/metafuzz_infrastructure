For binary-only program instrumentation, Comby is unsuitable as it requires source to operate.
Instead, we leverage the robust binary rewriting techniques provided by Zipr.~\cite{hawkins2017zipr, hiser2017zipr++,zipr}
Zipr has undergone rigorous third-party evaluation involving thousands of binaries spanning across about 50 unique programs
compiled with various compilers and compiler flags and seen no failures.~\cite{schulte2022broad}
Zipr's plug-in architecture allows arbitrary insert, delete, or modification of 
code or data items as well as allowing plugins to be composed, making it ideal for meta-fuzzing.  
In fact, PI Davidson and the UVA senior personnel,
Dr. Hiser and Dr. Nguyen-Tuong, have already leveraged it to build an 
AFL-compatible instrumentation plugin for Zipr, called
Zafl.~\cite{zafl}  
Experiments show that Zafl instrumentation provides the same
coverage and bug-finding effectiveness as compiler-inserted instrumentation.~\cite{nagy2021breaking}
Zafl also supports input-program mutation to enable faster fuzzing with techniques such as Intel LAF 
(which converts word-length \textit{cmp} instructions to byte-compare instructions similar to what was 
shown in Section~\ref{sec:intro}) or adding temporary breakpoint instructions to
run most coverage tracing at zero overhead.~\cite{intel2016circumventing,nagy2021same}
Zafl has the program mutation and instrumentation passes in separate Zipr plugins, allowing a user to mix-and-match
transforms (in a very meta-fuzzing manner) to suit the needs of their program.

As part of this effort, we will integrate Zipr and Zafl and allow people to extend the binary-only fuzzing
capabilities by adding new plugins to the infrastructure.  We do not expect significant effort to be used to 
develop these already robust components, allowing the infrastructure to leverage their capabilities in to help
build future binary-only meta-fuzzing transformations.
